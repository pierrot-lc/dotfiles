# Valid themes should do a lot of things:
# - support a wide range of applications
# - have a dark and light version
# - be open source and have a nice community around it
#
# List of currently impacted applications that themes must support:
# - bat (fzf, git-delta)
# - kitty
# - nvim (should support common plugins such as mini.nvim)
#
# Valid themes:
# - [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)
# - [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox-contrib)
# - [ros√©-pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/)
